# Authority & Compliance Laws

This folder is the single source of truth for every law that governs the platform control workspace template (this repo). The Authority & Compliance worker maintains this file, ensures incoming TODOs reference the relevant laws, and confirms the automation/verifications cited in each law are satisfied before work moves to implementation.

## Law catalog

| Law | Summary | References / Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **UI Integrity Law** | Every UI path must be complete—fields, validations, success/error states, and navigation fallbacks. Partial flows are “under review” until the TODO documents remediation; the roadmap, governance, and README UI sections cite this law before touching interfaces. | README `UI Rules`, `Auth Security Blueprint`; GOVERNANCE `UI Rules`; TODO-009 automation for visual regression; `scripts/update_tree.sh` ensures UI docs appear in `TREE.md`. |
| **Email Integrity Law** | All outbound emails (marketing, auth, automation alerts) must be fully defined templates, tied to the relevant TODO, and processed via TODO-009 automation (Resend preview scripts, verification logs). Stubs are forbidden unless a follow-up TODO documents the plan. | README `Marketing Automation & Resend Workflows`; GOVERNANCE `Email Integrity Law`; `marketing/status.md` and automation logs; `scripts/update_tree.sh`. |
| **Marketing Refresh Law** | Marketing refreshes must obey Email Integrity, Truth Governance, and UI Integrity laws: each refreshed page/todo cites the governing sections, runs the preview scripts listed in `marketing/status.md`, and logs automation results (Resend previews, Lighthouse/perf, screenshot diffs) before final verification. | README `Marketing Refresh Blueprint`, `Marketing & Auth Planning`; `marketing/status.md`; `TODO-033` verification; `scripts/preview-home.sh`, `scripts/community-preview.sh`, `scripts/roadmap-preview.sh`, `scripts/integrations-preview.sh`, `scripts/contact-preview.sh`; `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`. |
| **Marketing Outreach Automation Law** | Marketing outreach campaigns must enforce the Email Integrity, Automation & Productivity, and Truth Governance laws: each campaign must cite the README Marketing Outreach Automation blueprint, mention the CTA/resend templates in `marketing/status.md`, run the preview scripts/resend checks, add the automation traces to `scripts/logs/marketing-outreach-run.md`, and document the Sequencer batch reference before completing the TODO. | README `Marketing Outreach Automation (TODO-043)`; `marketing/status.md`; `scripts/logs/marketing-outreach-run.md`; `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; TODO-043 verification block. |
| **Auth Governance Law** | Every auth surface (workspace-aware sign-in, MFA, API keys, password resets, policy overrides) requires deterministic verification, multi-server readiness, and audit trails. Auth changes must run smoke tests, audit log monitors, and Git automation before closing the TODO. | README `Auth Security Blueprint`; GOVERNANCE `Auth Governance & Safeguards`; TODO-009 automation; `scripts/git-sync.sh` + `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `ROADMAP.md` auth guard rails. |
| **Workflow Reference Law** | Managers/workers consult the roadmap, queue, tree, and active TODO before acting, and update those artifacts when tasks add files or scope. | README `Workspace Intelligence`; GOVERNANCE `Workflow Reference Law`; `queue.md`; `TREE.md`; `ROADMAP.md`. |
| **Git Workflow Law** | Git operations use `scripts/git-sync.sh`, `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, `git/branches.md`, and branch names like `codex/<TODO>-<short>`; commits reference the active TODO and rerun automation logs so Authority can trace every change. | README `Git & Version Control Discipline`; GOVERNANCE `Git Workflow Law`; `git/workflow.md`; automation scripts. |
| **Git Automation Exclusivity Law** | All add/commit/push operations must run via `scripts/git-sync.sh` (or `scripts/run-safe.sh`), include the active TODO ID, stage the mandatory patch bump, and rerun the pre-commit `scripts/verify-roadmap-sync.sh` plus `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh` before pushing; skipping the automation or using manual git commands violates this law. | README `Automation Entrypoint`, README `Git Automation Reporting Blueprint`; `scripts/git-sync.sh`; `scripts/run-safe.sh`; `CODEX.worker.md` Git & Branch Tracking description; `queue.md`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **CI Verification Gate Law** | GitHub Actions must run the canonical verification stack (`scripts/verify-roadmap-sync.sh`, `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh`, `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`, `scripts/run-audit.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`) on every `push`/`pull_request`, preserve audit/branch/tree artifacts, and fail merges until all gates pass; CI failures block approvals, and any CI/local drift triggers enforcement of the Git Automation Exclusivity, Approval-Gated Merge Automation, Mandatory Patch Version, and Process Integrity laws before workflow resumption. | README `CI Verification Gate`; GOVERNANCE `CI as Mandatory Verifier`; git/workflow `CI as Independent Verifier`; `.github/workflows/ci-integrity.yml`; `.github/workflows/ci-merge-readiness.yml`; `scripts/verify-roadmap-sync.sh`; `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh`; `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`; `scripts/run-audit.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; `git/branches.md`; `TREE.md`. |
| **Privileged CI Execution Law** | Force-with-lease operations are forbidden locally; the privileged CI workflow `ci-force-align.yml` runs only when an approval artifact matching TODO-075 exists, validates the approved SHAs, pushes with `git push --force-with-lease origin master`, refreshes `git/branches.md`, regenerates the merge report and audit, and uploads the artifacts before signing off so the canonical remote tracking state remains auditable. | README `Remote Canonical Alignment (CI-only)`; GOVERNANCE `CI-only force alignment`; git/workflow `Force Alignment: CI-only workflow_dispatch`; `.github/workflows/ci-force-align.yml`; `git/approvals/approved/`; `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; `scripts/run-audit.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Approval-Gated Merge Automation Law** | Merges target `master`, require `scripts/git-merge-with-approval.sh` to run the pre/post merge reports, check for conflicts, verify the approval artifact matches the target/source SHAs plus timestamp, and rerun `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, `scripts/update_tree.sh`, and `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh` afterward; missing approval, stale reports, or dirty/conflicting trees breach this law. | README `Git Automation Reporting Blueprint`; `git/workflow.md`; `scripts/git-merge-with-approval.sh`; `git/merge-reports/`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`; `CODEX.worker.md` Sequencer & Git oversight sections. |
| **Mandatory Patch Version Law** | Every change increments the patch digit in `VERSION.md`, records the `Bumped By` TODO, and logs the timestamp so auditors know which modification corresponds to which version; commits are invalid unless the patch metadata updates accompany each automation run. | README `Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint`; `VERSION.md`; `git/versioning.md`; `scripts/git-sync.sh`; `TODO.md` (TODO-072 entry); `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Authority Law** | The `authority/` folder is the single source of laws, and every new idea must cite a law before implementation; the Authority & Compliance worker keeps the catalog updated and ties queue/roadmap/TODO entries back to law enforcement automation. | README `Key Reference Files`, `Workspace Intelligence`, `Authority & Compliance Laws section`; GOVERNANCE `Authority & Law Catalog`; `queue.md` entries; `scripts/update_tree.sh`. |
| **Truth Governance Law** | Reports, automation checklists, and TODO verifications must cite authoritative files rather than guesswork; each claim references README, governance, or TODO sources and records truth-refresh notes so incoming agents can trust the documents before acting. | README `Truth Governance for Reports`, `Workspace Intelligence`; GOVERNANCE `Truth Governance for Reports`; TODO verification blocks; `review.log`/`queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`. |
| **Queue Discipline Law** | Every request enters `queue.md` before the roadmap or TODO list grows; the queue entry captures the law references, blockers, and status so managers can assign TODOs deterministically. | README `Workspace Intelligence`; GOVERNANCE `Workflow Reference Law`; `queue.md`; `ROADMAP.md`; `TODO.md`. |
| **Canonical Artifact Law** | The canonical backlog of queued TODOs lives only in `queue.md`; any enumerated backlog list outside that file (including `ROADMAP.md`) is non-canonical and must be rewritten to reference `queue.md`. Process Integrity enforcement runs `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh` to detect such enumerations, fail the gate, and log the violation inside `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md` before the gate can close so the canonical queue stays singular. | README `Canonical queue authority`, README `Roadmap Sync Gate`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Canonical Queue Authority; `queue.md`; `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Queue & Tree Automation Law** | Queue entries and `TREE.md` updates run through `scripts/update_tree.sh`, and the Sequencer & Batch Oversight worker records the automation log while batching every third TODO cycle so the triple verification summary can cite the law before closing the batch. | README `Queue & Tree Automation Implementation`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; `queue.md`; `TREE.md`; TODOs 036–038/041 verification; `GOVERNANCE.md` Batch Completion Oversight. |
| **Roadmap Sync Law** | Roadmap, TODO, queue, and version artifacts must stay synchronized before closing any TODO; the sync gate scripts (`scripts/verify-roadmap-sync.sh`, `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh`) demand a single active TODO, matching completed TODOs, accurate roadmap statuses, a future-only queue, and version metadata references while logging any drift into `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. Queue state is canonical only in `queue.md`—any enumerated “Queued TODOs” list in `ROADMAP.md` is non-canonical, and the Process Integrity sweep enforces this by flagging enumerated queued IDs before the gate closes. TODO-055 (Automation & Productivity tooling inventory) documents this Process Integrity Law guard and explains how the Batched Sequential Execution guard (via the Batch Verification Law) exercises these scripts. | README `Roadmap Sync Gate`, README `Automation & Productivity Inventory`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Roadmap Sync Gate; `scripts/verify-roadmap-sync.sh`; `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`; `scripts/logs/automation-inventory.md`. |
| **Process Integrity Law** | Process Integrity audit automation (`scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`) watches canonical artifacts (TODO.md, ROADMAP.md, queue.md, VERSION.md, TREE.md); it fails the sweep whenever ROADMAP enumerates queued IDs outside `queue.md`, logs the violation to `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`, and blocks TODO closure until the enumeration is removed. | README `Process Integrity audit`, README `Roadmap Sync Gate`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Canonical Queue Authority; `queue.md`; `ROADMAP.md`; `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Audit Integrity Law** | The Audit Service is a governed platform capability that produces deterministic snapshots of governance, laws, automation, workers, and template/app separation; audits must run via `scripts/run-audit.sh` before major template evolution, and the metadata/log artifacts prove the Process Integrity, Deterministic Versioning, and Template Integrity guarantees.| README `Audit Service`, `observability/audit/AUDIT.README.md`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Audit Service section; `CODEX.worker.md` Audit Service workers; `observability/audit/AUDIT.SCOPE.md`; `observability/audit/AUDIT.REPORT.md`; `observability/audit/AUDIT.METADATA.json`; `scripts/run-audit.sh`; `scripts/logs/audit-runs.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; `VERSION.md`; `ROADMAP.md`; `queue.md`. |
| **Phase Re-Sequencing Law** | Phase re-sequencing is legal only when the template appears in README/GOVERNANCE, the template’s human roadmap file (this workspace uses `APP.ROADMAP.md` as the illustrative file) reflects the updated narrative, canonical artifacts remain untouched, and the update is noted without touching execution scripts or queued TODOs. | README `Governance TODO — Phase Re-Sequencing template`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Phase Re-Sequencing template section; the template’s human roadmap file (`APP.ROADMAP.md` in this repo); `TODO.md` (TODO-068 entry); `queue.md`. |
| **Progress Watchdog Law** | A conceptual Progress Watchdog watches for stagnation, static phase percentages, gaps between governance and implementation, or queue growth that exceeds completion; it logs warnings (e.g., in `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`) and recommends corrective governance TODOs without executing work, ensuring Canonical Artifact, Process Integrity, and System Gap Surfacing laws stay front of mind. | README `Progress Watchdog (Governance function)`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Progress Watchdog section; `CODEX.worker.md`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Marketing Truth Law** | Marketing artifacts must cite the canonical `VERSION.md`, active phase, and milestone references; the Marketing Steward enforces this by logging any marketing surface lacking the required version context. | README `Marketing Governance & Stewardship`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Marketing Truth & Drift Enforcement; `CODEX.worker.md` Marketing Steward worker; `marketing/status.md`; `VERSION.md`. |
| **Marketing Drift Detection Law** | The Progress Watchdog monitors marketing drift (mismatched versions, future milestone claims, or references to unrecorded TODOs), logs warnings in `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`, and keeps governance aware of marketing risk without executing changes. | README `Marketing Governance & Stewardship`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Marketing Truth & Drift Enforcement; `CODEX.worker.md` Progress Watchdog section; `marketing/status.md`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Surface Version Compatibility Law** | Surface artifacts declare their versions so the Process Integrity sweep can compare marketing/documentation versions to the platform MAJOR.MINOR values and report drift warnings when misaligned. | README `Documentation Versioning`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Documentation Versioning; `VERSION.md`; `marketing/status.md`; the template’s human roadmap file (`APP.ROADMAP.md` in this repo); `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`. |
| **Automated Drift Detection Law** | Drift warnings are emitted (without blocking) when surface versions diverge from the canonical platform version; these warnings log into `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md` and feed the Progress Watchdog so governance can resolve them via dedicated TODOs. | README `Documentation Versioning`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Documentation Versioning; `CODEX.worker.md` Progress Watchdog section; `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Git-Ready Notification Rule** | When no active TODO exists, Process Integrity plus the Roadmap Sync and Version Sync gates all pass, and git reports pending local changes, Codex logs the condition, prints a single “Approval Required” message, and halts until a human approval artifact appears so the human approval stays the only manual finger on the merge switch. | README `Git-Ready Notification`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Git-Ready Notification Rule; `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **MicroMDM & Marketplace Law** | MicroMDM readiness and the App Marketplace concept must be documented in the roadmap and governance before any app or device policy change; every law referencing MicroMDM/App Store references the app’s `*.details.md` (this template uses `APP.details.md` for illustration), `ROADMAP.md`, and the automation guard rails. | README `Platform Infrastructure > Multi-server Deployment Blueprint`; the active app details file (`APP.details.md` sample); ROADMAP `MicroMDM & App Marketplace (future)`; TODOs tied to microMDM or App Marketplace entries. |
| **App Marketplace & Atlas Readiness Law** | App Marketplace submissions and Atlas integrations follow deterministic guard rails: README and the app’s `*.details.md` describe the criteria, queue/roadmap entries describe readiness steps, and automation scripts (`scripts/update_tree.sh`, `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`) capture the verification outputs before publication. | README `App Marketplace & Atlas Readiness`; the active app details file (`APP.details.md` sample) App Marketplace & MicroMDM readiness section; `queue.md` integration note; `ROADMAP.md` Active/Completed entries for TODO-059; `scripts/update_tree.sh`, `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`. |
| **Git Automation Law** | All branch creation, commit, and push actions run through scripted automation (`scripts/git-sync.sh`) that stages, commits, and pushes to the `codex/<TODO>-<short>` branch tied to the current TODO. Merge reporting is generated before merges, and every branch log entry references the automation outputs. | README `Git & Version Control Discipline`; `git/workflow.md`; TODO-028 instructions; `scripts/git-sync.sh`; `git/branches.md`. |
| **Merge Reporting Law** | Before any merge, run `scripts/git-merge-report.sh` so the report captures origin, targets, commits, ahead/behind counts, and the canonical template remote; store the markdown in `git/merge-reports/`, reference it inside the TODO verification block, and log it for the Sequencer worker to confirm Merge Reporting enforcement when closing the surrounding batch. | README `Git & Version Control Discipline`; `git/workflow.md`; `queue.md`; `git/merge-reports/`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; Sequencer verification log. |
| **Merge-Report Retention Law** | Merge reports are categorized as canonical, redundant, or disposable; canonical artifacts remain in `git/merge-reports/` and stay cited by `TODO.complete.md`, redundant ones move to `git/merge-reports/archive/` only within governed archival TODOs, and disposable (bootstrap) reports require an explicit governance TODO before deletion. | README `Merge-Report Retention Policy`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Merge-Report Retention Policy; `TODO.complete.md`; `git/merge-reports/`; `queue.md`. |
| **Triple-TODO Merge Cadence Law** | Merges are scheduled only after a triple-TODO cycle (e.g., TODO-047/048/049) finishes, the Git worker runs `scripts/git-sync.sh`, `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, and `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`, and the Coordinator & Best Practices worker verifies the merge report plus law citations; the Sequencer records that batch summary (including the merge report reference) before allowing a human-approved merge. | README `Git & Version Control Discipline`; `scripts/git-sync.sh`; `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; `queue.md`; `scripts/logs/worker-coordinator.md`; Sequencer automation log. |
| **Law Catalog Maintenance Law** | Updating the authority catalog is itself governed: every new law or revision notes its verification steps, associated automation (update_tree/git-branch-log/merge-report), and worker assignment before the law is accepted into the repository; this ensures the catalog stays consistent across queue/roadmap/README. | README `Authority Folder Plan`; GOV `Documentation & Verification Discipline`; `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; TODO-030. |
| **Multi-App Expansion Law** | Every new service proposal follows the queued blueprint: queue entry with laws (Authority, Queue Discipline, UI Integrity, Email Integrity, Observability Safeguards), worker assignments, automation outputs (Resend previews, Observability smoke tests, React Flow renders), multi-server readiness notes, and merge-report logs. The related TODO (e.g., TODO-031) documents these steps in README/ROADMAP/the app’s `*.details.md`, runs the automation scripts, and logs the merge report before closing the task. | README `Multi-App Service Expansion Blueprint`/`Roadmap Discipline`; the active app details section (sample `APP.details.md` expansion section); `ROADMAP.md` blueprint entry; `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; TODO-031 verification block. |
| **Observability Automation Law** | Observability automation work obeys the Observability Playbook, Automation & Productivity Program, and queue discipline: proposals live in `queue.md`, cite the Observability Automation blueprint, expand the instrumentation catalog (Law Catalog Maintenance Law), execute telemetry automation (Resend previews, Observability smoke tests, React Flow renders, multi-server readiness scripts), rerun `scripts/update_tree.sh`, document the automation log, and include the batch summary so the Sequencer worker can cite it when closing the third TODO in a cycle. | README `Observability Automation Blueprint`, `Observability Playbook`, `Workspace Intelligence`; the active app details section (sample `APP.details.md` Observability Automation section); `ROADMAP.md` Observability Automations Blueprint; `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`, `scripts/logs/sequencer-batch-042.md`; TODO-032 verification block; Sequencer automation log; Law Catalog Maintenance Law. |
| **Versioning & Incident Logging Law** | Version bumps and incident logs must reference the active TODO, cite `git/versioning.md`, and include entries in `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md` so every change/ticket ties the version, automation outcome, and remediation back to a law-referenced TODO before merging; this governance path is the Version Sync Law. TODO-055 (Automation & Productivity tooling inventory) catalogs the README/log artifacts plus `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh` that keep the Version Sync Law observable. | README `Versioning & Error Logging Discipline (TODO-045)`, README `Automation & Productivity Inventory`; `git/versioning.md`; `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`; `ROADMAP.md` Guard rails; `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; Sequencer batch logs; `scripts/logs/automation-inventory.md`. |
| **Deterministic Versioning Law** | Every TODO completion bumps `VERSION.md` (PATCH for governance, MICRO for implementations, higher when declared); the canonical artifact records previous/new versions, bump type, triggering TODO, and compatibility notes so no two commits share the same string and the Non-Interruptible + Manager Automation Hardening laws can enforce deterministic closeouts. | README `Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint`; `VERSION.md`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Non-Interruptible TODO Execution section; `TODO.complete.md`; `scripts/verify-version-sync.sh`. |
| **Platform Compatibility Enforcement Law** | Apps declare `minPlatformVersion`/`maxTestedPlatformVersion`; MAJOR mismatches block deployment, MINOR mismatches surface warnings, and MICRO/PATCH mismatches stay informational while the compatibility matrix (`COMPATIBILITY.md` when created) records the outcome so the law ties into the Version Compatibility Contract and drift detection log. | README `Derived App Compatibility Rules`, `Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint; `VERSION.md`; future `COMPATIBILITY.md`; `scripts/logs/error-incidents.md`. |
| **Non-Interruptible TODO Execution Law** | Once a TODO activates, Codex must execute, verify, and close it in a single run; the law forbids pauses, requires `VERSION.md` updates before closing, and links the Manager Closeout Checklist + Process Integrity sweep to the deterministic release cycle so every completion stays traceable. | README `Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint; `CODEX.manager.md`; `scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`; `VERSION.md`. |
| **Manager Automation Hardening Law** | Managers must obey the Manager Hard Obligations (pre-activation, pre-close checks) and the Manager Closeout Checklist, confirming queue/roadmap/version alignment, Non-Interruptible execution, and the new deterministic release metadata before recording the completion summary in `TODO.complete.md`. | README `Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint`, `Standard Update Flow`; `CODEX.manager.md` Manager Hard Obligations section; `TODO.complete.md`; `queue.md`. |
| **Version Compatibility Contract Law** | Apps declare min/max platform versions, refuse unknown MAJOR versions, warn staff on MINOR mismatches, and log MICRO/PATCH drift; the compatibility matrix (`COMPATIBILITY.md` when created), version metadata, and the Platform Compatibility Enforcement Law keep multi-app upgrades predictable and documented. | README `Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint`; `GOVERNANCE.md` Deterministic Versioning & Compatibility Blueprint; `VERSION.md`; future `COMPATIBILITY.md`; `queue.md`. |
| **LLM Safeguards Law** | Any LLM output stays “draft” until verified against truth sources. Prompts, responses, and rate-limits are logged, and outputs are compared to README/governance before being recorded. | README `LLM Governance & Safeguards`; GOVERNANCE `LLM Integration Rules`; TODO-021; automation logs (TODO-009); `scripts/update_tree.sh`. |
| **LLM Integration Blueprint Law** | The LLM blueprint (TODO-034) is queued, law-referenced, automation-tracked, and multi-server ready: `queue.md` records owners/blockers/laws, README/the app’s `*.details.md` (this template uses `APP.details.md`) describe automation/cluster expectations, automation logs capture prompts/responses/hallucination checks, and merge reports archive the branches touching the assistant before merge-ready states. | README `LLM Integration Blueprint`; the active app details section (sample `APP.details.md` LLM Integration Blueprint); `ROADMAP.md` (if referenced); `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; TODO-034 verification block. |
| **Change Review Safeguards Law** | Every modification undergoes a review pass that checks for redundancy or conflicts, logs the reasoning, and references the governing TODO before closing. | GOVERNANCE `Change Review Safeguards`; README sections referencing review logs; `scripts/update_tree.sh`. |
| **Rewrite-over-delete Law** | Files should be rewritten in place rather than deleted/recreated when updating content; delete only obsolete artifacts. | README `File Hygiene`; GOVERNANCE `Folder Structure Workflow`; `TODO` notes on silencing; `scripts/logs/worker-coordinator.md`. |
| **Tri-TODO Silence Law** | Codex managers provide textual summaries or notable updates only after every third TODO cycle completes; between cycles, remain silently focused on execution and logging inside the TODO/verification artifacts. | README `Silence Protocol`; GOVERNANCE `Execution Rules`; TODO verification blocks; `scripts/logs/worker-coordinator.md`. |
| **Git Cadence & Approval Law** | After completing six TODOs in a row, the Git & Branch Tracking worker must add, commit, and push the changes, then document that a human approval is required before merging; once approval is granted, the worker reviews all branches, determines the best merge approach, and merges every required branch while capturing merge reports and law references. | README `Git Discipline`; GOVERNANCE `Git Workflow Law`; TODO verification blocks (post-six TODOs); `git/merge-reports`; `scripts/logs/worker-coordinator.md`. |
| **Batch Verification Law** | Documentation, automation logs, and governance verification happen once every three sequential TODOs; the Sequencer & Batch Oversight worker aggregates law references (Queue & Tree Automation, Observability Automation, Merge Reporting, Merge Audit), automation outputs, queue snapshots, and merge reports before closing the third TODO so the workflow honors deterministic reporting without redundant updates. TODO-055 (Automation & Productivity tooling inventory) catalogs the same tools that uphold this Batched Sequential Execution cycle, confirming the automation trio and law references before every batch close. | README `LLM Integration Blueprint`, `Workspace Intelligence`, README `Automation & Productivity Inventory`; GOVERNANCE `Batch Completion Oversight`; TODO verification blocks across the triple (e.g., TODO-032/033/034); `queue.md`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; Sequencer automation log; `scripts/logs/automation-inventory.md`. |
| **Silent Execution Law** | Codex Managers execute silently: they never solicit next steps, describe roadmap/queue state, or ask for activation when no TODO is active, and they only speak when a STOP CONDITION occurs; idle workspaces stay quiet until new TODOs appear. | README `IDLE SILENCE` section; GOVERNANCE `Execution Rules`; TODO `Silence enforcement` notes; `scripts/logs/worker-coordinator.md`. |
| **Merge Audit Law** | Every merge-ready TODO runs the merge audit routine: `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`, and `scripts/update_tree.sh` execute, the results land in `git/branches.md` and `git/merge-reports/`, and the Sequencer worker records the audit log plus Batch Verification Law references when closing the third TODO in any merge-involved batch. | README `Git Merge Audit Routine`; `git/workflow.md`; `git/branches.md`; `git/merge-reports/`; `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; TODO-040 verification block; Sequencer automation log. |

| **Executable TODO Law** | Every active TODO requires an enumerated Execution Scope checklist plus its objective, file list, and verification contract before activation, and workers halt if the scope is missing. | README `Execution Discipline` & `Workspace Intelligence`; GOVERNANCE `Steward Preflight Checklist`; CODEX.worker `Execution-only behavior`; `scripts/update_tree.sh`, `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`. |
## Enforcement workflow
- Before a new TODO references a law, the Authority & Compliance worker verifies the law entry, notes the coverage in `queue.md`, and ensures the required automation scripts (e.g., preview, git-sync, audit log) ran.
- When a law is updated, rerun `scripts/git-branch-log.sh` and `scripts/update_tree.sh`, update this file with the new version stamp, and record the verification results inside the TODO’s verification block.


## Executable TODO Law

Any TODO that becomes active MUST contain an explicit, enumerated **Execution Scope** section.

The Execution Scope MUST:
- Be written as a concrete checklist
- Enumerate all documentation, files, or artifacts to be produced or modified
- Contain no ambiguous phrases (including but not limited to: “polish”, “refresh”, “align”, “review”, or “improve” without enumeration)

A TODO lacking an Execution Scope is INVALID and MUST NOT be activated.

Workers MUST NOT infer, invent, or assume scope.
If an active TODO is missing an Execution Scope, execution MUST halt and request clarification.

This law is mandatory and supersedes all implicit scope assumptions.

Verification requires rerunning `scripts/update_tree.sh`, `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`, and `scripts/git-merge-report.sh` after updating the law or TODO governance artifacts.

## System Gap Surfacing (Suggestion) Law

Codex MUST proactively surface gaps where declared intent exists without downstream realization.

If any authoritative artifact (laws, governance, roadmap, details, completed TODOs) defines or implies a system property, capability, or invariant, and no active or queued TODO exists to implement or verify it, Codex MUST:
1. Explicitly identify the gap
2. Cite the governing artifact(s)
3. Enqueue a corrective TODO with an objective, Execution Scope checklist, allowed files, verification contract, and Lifecycle target (Implemented or Verified)

Silence in the presence of detectable gaps is forbidden.

This law converts system insight into mandatory action.

| **Governance-to-Implementation Continuity Law** | Every governance/blueprint TODO must spawn at least one implementation TODO unless explicitly documentation-only, and the Feature Realization Auditor alerts the queue when a gap appears. | README `Lifecycle Discipline`; GOVERNANCE `Lifecycle Status Model`; CODEX.worker `Execution-only behavior`; `queue.md` entries; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`.
| **System Gap Surfacing (Suggestion) Law** | Codex must detect and enqueue corrective TODOs for any declared intent lacking implementation or verification, turning each gap into an actionable Execution Scope. | README `Suggestion & Gap Discipline`; GOVERNANCE `System Health Report` & `Verification TODO Rule`; CODEX.worker `Auditor Worker (Template)`; `queue.md` entries; `scripts/update_tree.sh`; `scripts/git-branch-log.sh`; `scripts/git-merge-report.sh`.

## Governance-to-Implementation Continuity Law

Any TODO whose objective is to define, govern, plan, or blueprint a feature or system MUST be followed by at least one implementation TODO, unless the feature is explicitly marked as documentation-only.

A completed governance TODO without a corresponding implementation TODO is an incomplete lifecycle state.

The Feature Realization Auditor is responsible for detecting such gaps and enqueueing corrective implementation TODOs.

This law ensures that governance artifacts result in functional systems.

## Prompt Normalization Law

All human prompts are considered unstructured intent by default.

Before any execution may occur, Codex MUST normalize the prompt into a canonical execution contract containing Authority, Prompt Type, Objective, Constraints, Required Actions, Postflight Obligations, and Verification.

If a prompt cannot be normalized without inference, execution MUST halt with a law-cited error describing the missing elements.

Execution without successful prompt normalization is forbidden.

## Sequential TODO Auto-Advance Law

When an active TODO is fully completed and verified, Codex is authorized to automatically activate the next TODO in queue order.

Rules:
- Only one TODO may be active at any time.
- The next TODO may be activated only after the current TODO is closed.
- All lifecycle, criticality, verification, and auditor rules remain enforced.
- Auto-advance stops immediately if a TODO fails verification or is blocked.

Human activation is not required for sequential execution.
