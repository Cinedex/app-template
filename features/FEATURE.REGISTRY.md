# Feature Registry

| Feature | Criticality | Lifecycle | Defined By | Implemented By | Verified By | Impacted Systems | Blocking Phase | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Template Readiness | Critical | Verified | TODO-TEMPLATE-001 | TODO-TEMPLATE-001 | TODO-TEMPLATE-001 | README/GOVERNANCE/authority/feature registry/automation trio | Phase 1.5 | Marks this workspace as the reusable platform template; derived apps instantiate their own feature set per `<app>.details.md` while retaining the same governance, automation, and verification guard rails.
| Observability Governance | Non-Critical | Defined | TODO-053 | TODO-062 | TODO-058 | Observability automation, README, Pulse | Phase 2 | Configures instrumentation narrative, automation guards, Feature Registry entries; TODO-058 records the LLM safeguards state so prompts/rate-limit instrumentation and the Observability run log cite LLM Safeguards Law + Observability Automation Law.
| Marketing Refresh Loop | Non-Critical | Verified | TODO-054 | TODO-054 | TODO-054 | Marketing automation, README outreach sections, automation logs | Phase 5 | Aligns Resend preview plans with Email Integrity & Truth Governance laws while the Roadmap Sync gate (`scripts/process-integrity-sweep.sh`) protects every automation burst; verification recorded in `git/merge-reports/merge-report-master-20260206T003406Z.md`.
| Versioning System | Critical | Implemented (target) | TODO-060 | TODO-060 | TODO-062 (pending) | Platform release, dashboards, automation reports | Phase 5 | Requires `VERSION.md`, deterministic bump rules (`git/versioning.md`), automation logs/merge reports that ingest the artifact, and Pulse dashboards that echo the version string. |
| Instrumentation Runtime | Critical | Implemented (target) | TODO-062 | TODO-062 | TODO-063 (pending) | Observability pipelines, instrumentation catalog, automation logs, Pulse dashboards | Phase 5 | Wiring doc (`observability/runtime-wiring.md`) and the instrumentation catalog tie runtime probes back to TODO-062 so automation logs and Pulse echo the same release string.
| Pulse Ingestion | Critical | Verified | TODO-063 | TODO-063 | TODO-063 | Observability pipelines, automation logs, Pulse dashboards, System Health Report | Phase 6 | Pulse ingestion verification doc (`pulse/ingestion-verification.md`) now ties the runtime wiring catalog, instrumentation owners, and `VERSION.md` artifact to TODO-063 so the registry, automation logs, and Pulse dashboards read the same release string.
