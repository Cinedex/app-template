# Sequencer Batch 042 Log

- **Batch:** TODO-042/043/044
- **Laws planned:** Observability Automation Law, Law Catalog Maintenance Law, Batch Verification Law
- **Automation outputs to capture:** `scripts/update_tree.sh` (tree refresh), Observability smoke tests, automation tracker entries, `scripts/logs/observability-runs.md`, `scripts/git-merge-report.sh` (when merges appear), and the instrumentation catalog audit note.
- **Notes:** Record the Observability Ops automation verification, instrumentation catalog updates, and Sequencer batch summary in this file once TODO-042 completes so the worker can cite the same log when closing the third TODO in the cycle. Include law references, automation timestamps, and any follow-up actions for TODO-043/044 before finishing the batch.
